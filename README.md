* I woked up on 03:00 AM, because I reseted my PC and it took so long, so I decided to sleep in this time and woked up on this time, where the reset was finally finished. I had to make the setup finished. I was done with everything and was going to sleep.

### 07:00 AM
* I woked up on this time with my brother. I cooked pancakes w/ Nutella for me and my brother.
